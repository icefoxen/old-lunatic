Okay!  Here we go.
A COMPILED, DYNMAIC-TYPED, TAGGED language.

You can put in type-annotations and it will insert runtime type-checking code,
and maybe optimize stuff (later).

Maybe functions can be redefined at runtime?  Hmm, then a function would
pretty much be a name/args and an address...  But unused functions would
get... weird.
Leave it for now!

Garbage collection?!  Not yet!

...this is turning out to be more complicated than anticipated.


Types:
Int
Bool
Char
Float (somehow)


Array
List?

Struct?
Object?
Tuple?

Ratio?
