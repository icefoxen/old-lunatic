A small, relatively simple editor.  Well, sorta.  Think Scite + pico with a
dash of emacs.

Both terminal and graphical modes.

Displaying a line-number for the current line, and going to a certain line
should be easy.

Basic shortcuts can be shown along bottom of screen, a la joe or pico

F1 for help!

Scripting with Python or Ruby or Scheme or Lua.

Syntax highlighting.

Folding?  Make it simple...

Auto-indentation, a la emacs.



UI:
Everything can be done with the keyboard.  Pie-menu shortcuts, often.
