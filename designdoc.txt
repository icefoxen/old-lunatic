Lunatic: A relatively simple but feature-complete text editor, written and
scripted in Lua.

wxWidgets?  It's looking better all the time... or at least less half-assed.

IDEAS
Keyboard-based, no menus (or pie-menus with quick-keying)
2 sets of functions, ctrl- and alt-?
Scripting, modules/plugins
Use the damn function keys!  Good memories of old DOS editors, there.
Buffers!
Shell/interpreter integration?

Display quick-help, a la joe and nano

Tabs?  Mouse-y...
Split-screen is NICE at times.
Syntax highlighting, or lex-highlighting at least
auto-tabbing
Spell-check



A database addon?  Store files in the DB, that is.

A database server in general, acts like a searching filesystem sorta thang...
Sets, matching, all kinda good things.  BDB or SQLite...  If there's some way
to wrap and generate SQL more nicely, I'd like to find it.
Networking could be added then, too.
Heheh... anyway...
